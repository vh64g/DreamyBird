# State of Dev
Since this project is completly new, we have a lot to do!
Until now, the .db3 Script in /data/db3code/ is read and I started by trying to parse every line to a lineHandler in /interpreter/LineHandler.py.
In the current commit, the lineHandler should detect empty lines, recognise var declarations and count the exclamation marks at the line ending.
Especially the exclamation mark count will need a lot of work, since it isn't really efficiant not can it handle exclamation marks in strings with double qoutes...
So even the little things I already have, will need a huge rework.
I hope together we will be able to achive more, and start coding in the best programming language ever build...
